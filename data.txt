Narendra Damodardas Modi[a] (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician who has served as the prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the member of parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindutva paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.

Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat), where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, becoming a full-time worker for the organisation in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998.[b] In 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots[c] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[4] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[d] While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[e]

In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programs. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. His demonetisation of banknotes in 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan; the airstrike failed,[5][6] but the action had nationalist appeal.[7] Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed. In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs.[8][9][10] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which, according to the World Health Organization, 4.7 million Indians died.[11][12] In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition. Following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, Modi presided over the 2025 India–Pakistan conflict, which resulted in a ceasefire.

Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding and has shifted towards an authoritarian style of government, with a cult of personality centred around him.[f] As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings within India. Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a highly controversial figure domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[g]

Early life and education
Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati family of Other Backward Class (OBC) background and Hindu faith[13][14] in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).[15][h][16] According to Modi and his neighbours, he worked infrequently in his father's tea stall in the Vadnagar railway station.[17][18][19]

Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre.[20] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[21][22]

When Modi was eight years old, he was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, who inducted Modi as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[23] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped found the BJP's Gujarat unit.[24] As a teenager, he was enrolled in the National Cadet Corps.[25]

In a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[26][27] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his wife,[28] and left home. The couple never divorced but the marriage was not in his public pronouncements for many decades.[27] In April 2014, shortly before the national election in which he gained power, Modi publicly affirmed he was married and that his spouse was Jashodaben.[29] A Modi biographer wrote that Modi kept the marriage a secret because he would not have been able to become a pracharak in the RSS, for which celibacy had once been a requirement.[30][31]

Modi spent the following two years travelling across northern and north-eastern India.[32] In mid 1968, Modi reached Belur Math but was turned away, after which he visited Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before returning to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 to 1969. In either late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad,[33][34] where he lived with his uncle and worked in his uncle's canteen at Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[35] Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi's life.[36]

In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar.[37][38][39] Modi's first-known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist to fight in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[40][41] The Indira Gandhi-led central government prohibited open support for the Mukti Bahini; according to Modi, he was briefly held in Tihar Jail.[42][43][44] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Modi left his uncle's employment and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[45] working under Inamdar.[46] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest in New Delhi against the Indian government, for which he was arrested; because of this arrest, Inamdar decided to mentor Modi.[46] According to Modi, he was part of a Satyagraha that led to a political war.[43][i]

In 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science from the School of Open Learning[49] at the Delhi University.[30][50] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[51][52] as an external distance learning student.[53] There is a controversy surrounding the authenticity of his BA and MA degrees.[54][55][j]

Early political career
In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "the Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[59][60] Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[61] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.[62] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[63][64] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[65] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In the Struggles of Gujarat), which describes events during the Emergency.[66][67] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.[68]

Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win.[69][70] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[71]


Modi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee in c. 2001
Modi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991–1992 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).[20][72][73] Modi took a brief break from politics in 1992 to establish a school in Ahmedabad, and due to friction with Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat.[73] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani; as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly election.[74][75] In November of that year, Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[76] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress[k] after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election.[20] Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election,[77] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[78]

Chief Minister of Gujarat (2001–2014)
Main article: Chief ministership of Narendra Modi
Taking office
In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing, and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[77][79][80] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[20] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was "going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[81] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in[82] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC after Vajubhai Vala vacated his seat.[83]

2002 Gujarat riots
Main article: 2002 Gujarat riots
On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[l][86] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[87][88] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.[89][87][90] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh (general strike) across the state.[91][92] Riots began during the bandh and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[87][91][92] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[87][93] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;[88] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000,[87][86][94] the vast majority of them Muslims.[86] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[95] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.[96][97]

Scholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[89][98] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[99] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.[96][100][101] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating.[91][92] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh despite such actions being illegal at the time.[89] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[102] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[103] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[96][90][104] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.[105][106][107] According to Martha Nussbaum, "There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law".[96]

Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, "What is happening is a chain of action and reaction".[96] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[108] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[99][109][110] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings.[109] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[109][111] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[112][113] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi.[114] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.[115][116][117]

Later terms as Chief Minister
Main article: 2002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election
Following the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party—partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition—and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[118] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[119] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[120] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[121] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[122][123][124][125] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.[120] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[126][122] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[121] seats—a two-thirds majority—in the state assembly.[126][122] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza.[127] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.[128]

During Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[79][126][122] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).[129] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[129][130] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[131][132]

Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[133][134] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom,[135][136] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.[135] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[137] and the EU[138] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.[139][140]


Modi meeting with then-Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in 2004
During the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[141] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.[142] In 2007, Modi wrote Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a "spiritual experience" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[143][144] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.[145] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.[146] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.[147] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[148]

Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear skullcap gifted by Muslim leaders.[122] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[122] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.[122] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[122] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[120] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[149] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure.[150] After his election as Prime Minister of India, Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister.[151]

Development projects

The Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase
As chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹20 trillion or US$240 billion in 2023) were signed.[79]

The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of large scale groundwater-conservation projects, which commentators credited with helping about half of the tehsils with depleted groundwater recharge their aquifers.[m] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[152] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[154] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 per cent from 2001 to 2007.[155] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4–6% of the area intended.[152] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano car after popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Following Tata, several other companies relocated to Gujarat.[156]

The Modi government finished the process of taking electricity to every village in Gujarat its predecessor had almost completed.[157] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised[152] but, according to an assessment study, corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[158]

Development debate
A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[159] The state's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate averaged 10% during his tenure, similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country.[156] Gujarat saw strong economic growth before Modi took office; some scholars state that growth did not accelerate during his tenure.[160] Under Modi, Gujarat performed well on measures of ease of doing business.[n] Tax breaks and land for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states. Modi's policies of making Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones in which labour laws were greatly weakened.[122] In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[126]

Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. Gujarat was ranked poorly within the country on education, and was reported to have a poor record of immunisation of children.[o] Under much of Modi's tenure Gujarat did not significantly change its rank among Indian states with respect to poverty, female literacy, or infant mortality.[p] The state government's social policies generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[103] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas and those from lower castes were increasingly marginalised.[166] Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare.[103]

In September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[167][168] Several BJP leaders,[169] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were "concerned with their personal agendas", expressed opposition to Modi's candidature.[170] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election campaign.[171][172] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate.[167][173][174] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[169][175] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[159]

During the campaign, Modi focused on corruption scandals under the previous Congress government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[169] He projected himself as a person who could bring about "development" without focusing on specific policies.[169] His message found support among young and middle-class people. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[172] Prior to the election, Modi's media image had centred around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign, the BJP focused on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[172] The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders who publicly opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose and Ram Manohar Lohia.[132] Hindutva remained a part of the campaign; BJP leaders used Hindutva-based rhetoric in several states.[176][169][173][177] Communal tensions were played upon, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Northeast India.[176] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto.[177] The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[164] Modi's campaign blitz cost around ₹50 billion (US$590 million)[159] and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[178] Modi made extensive use of social media[159][169] and addressed more than 1,000 rallies via hologram appearances.[177]

The BJP won 31 per cent of the vote,[179] and more-than-doubled its number of seats in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[172][173] Voter dissatisfaction with the Congress and with regional parties in North India, and support from the RSS were reasons for the BJP's success.[173][169] In states such as Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, and its Muslim vote increased to 10 per cent. The BJP performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[173] The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties towards the right-wing.[177][159][173][180][181] Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[182] Modi is the first Indian PM to be born after the country's independence from the British Empire in 1947.[183]

Modi was a candidate for the Lok Sabha constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara.[184] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[185] India's president appointed Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, Prime Minister of India.[186][187] To comply with the law prohibiting MPs from representing more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[188]

On 13 October 2018, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2019 general election.[189] The BJP's chief campaigner was its president Amit Shah. Modi launched the party's Main Bhi Chowkidar ("I too am a watchman") campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's campaign slogan Chowkidar Chor Hai ("The watchman is a thief").[190] In 2018, the Telugu Desam Party split from the NDA over the campaign for special status for Andhra Pradesh.[191]

Amit Shah launched the BJP's election campaign on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on allegations of corruption over the Rafale deal with the Government of France, highlighting the controversy surrounding the deal.[192] Modi's campaign focused on defence and national security, especially after the Pulwama attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrike, which was counted as an achievement of his administration.[193][194] Other topics in the campaign were development and good foreign relations in the first premiership.[195]

Modi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi; he won the seat by a margin of 479,505 votes, defeating Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who stood as a candidate for the SP-BSP alliance.[196][197] Modi was unanimously appointed prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance[198] after the alliance won the election for the second time with 353 seats in the Lok Sabha; the BJP alone won 303 seats.[199][200]

In November 2023, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2024 general election.[201] The BJP's chief campaigner was its home minister Amit Shah and President J. P. Nadda.[202] Modi launched the party's "Modi Ki Guarantee" ("Modi's assurance")[203] campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's guarantees campaigns, that led to the party's enormous victories in the assembly elections of Karnataka and Telangana.[204]

Modi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi for the third consecutive time; he won the seat by a margin of 152,513 votes, defeating Ajay Rai of the INC, who contested as a candidate for the SP-INC alliance. His victory margin was the second lowest ever (in percentage points) for a sitting Prime Minister in India after Chandra Sekhar.[205][206] The National Democratic Alliance secured a total of 292 seats, 20 seats ahead of simple majority, and the BJP solely winning 240 seats.[207][208][209] Modi thanked the voters for reposing faith in his government for the 3rd consecutive time.[210]

Modi addressing the Nation on the occasion of 74th Independence Day from the ramparts of Red Fort, in Delhi on 15 August 2020
Modi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[132][211] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[212] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[179] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),[213][214] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM.[212][215][216] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[214][217] In its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated.[132][215] Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed against individuals who criticised the government.[132][218] This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[132][212]

Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments in the previous 64 years.[219][220][221] Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy.[222][223]

In 2019, a law to reserve 10 per cent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged individuals was passed.[224][225] In 2016, Modi's administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014.[226] In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except those covered by the Ujjwala program.[227]

In 2023, the Modi administration issued a notification constituting a high-level committee on One Nation, One Election, a proposal aimed to synchronise all elections in the country either on a single day or within a specific time frame.[228] In September 2024, the bill for One Nation, One Election was approved by the Modi Cabinet.[229][230][231]

Since May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced.[232] Modi has been criticised for his lack of reaction towards the violence.[233]

Hindutva

The activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister, sometimes with the government's support.[234][235] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of "Love Jihad" (an Islamophobic[241] conspiracy theory)[236]: 226–227 [242]: 1–2 [243] and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha.[244][245] Government officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.[176]

Links between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed RSS-affiliated individuals to prominent government positions.[246] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[177] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned Rao's credentials as a historian and stated the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[177][247][248] During its first term, the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions, and recruitment of faculty members favouring the RSS increased. According to scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty, many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions.[249] The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government-approved history textbooks that de-emphasised the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorified that of Modi while also portraying Indian society as harmonious, and without conflict and inequity.[249][250]

In 2019, the Modi administration passed a citizenship law that provides a route to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians,[251][252] but does not grant eligibility to Muslims.[253][254][255] This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law; it attracted global criticism and prompted widespread protests that were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[249][255][256] Counter-demonstrations against the protests developed into the 2020 Delhi riots, caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims.[257][258] Fifty-three people were killed in the protests, two-thirds of whom were Muslim.[259][260][261][262][263] On 5 August 2020, Modi visited Ayodhya after the Supreme Court in 2019 ordered contested land in Ayodhya to be handed to a trust to build a Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternative 5 acres (2.0 ha) of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.[264] Modi became the first PM to visit temples at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi.[265]

Soon after Modi returned to power in 2019, he took three actions the RSS had long called for.[249] The practice of Triple Talaq was made illegal and became a punishable act from 1 August 2019.[266][267][268] The administration repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution that granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir,[269][270] and also abrogated its statehood, reorganising it into the union territories Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.[249][271] The region was placed under a lockdown and internet services were suspended and were not completely restored until February 2021.[272] Thousands of people, including hundreds of political leaders, were detained.[273][274][275][276] The Supreme Court of India did not hear constitutional challenges to the reorganisation or the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to Bhatty and Sundar, this is an example of the subversion of the Supreme Court and other major institutions, which were filled with appointees favouring the BJP.[249]

During his campaign for 2024 Indian general election, Modi referred to Muslims as infiltrators with many children who would take India's wealth, if his political opponents gained power.[277][278] In a later interview, Modi said that regardless of the social class, there are more children in neighbourhoods plagued by poverty. He said he made no mention of Muslim or Hindu in his campaign speech.[279][280] However, factcheckers have refuted this claim of Modi and found numerous instances across his election campaign where he communally targeted the Muslims.[281][282]

Economy

The Modi government's economic policies focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, and were based on a neoliberal framework.[215][283] Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways.[215][284][285] Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers, and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers;[283] some of these proposals were abandoned after protests.[286] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions—including one affiliated with the BJP—struck.[283] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS), stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.[215]

The funds dedicated to poverty-reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly reduced by Modi's administration.[132] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6 per cent of GDP during the previous Congress government to 12.6 per cent during Modi's first year in office, and spending on health and family welfare declined by 15 per cent.[215] The government lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold and jewellery.[215] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices.[287] During Modi's first term, his government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent.[288][289][290] The percentage of the budget spent on children's nutrition, education, health, and associated programmes was almost halved between 2014 and 2022.[291] Capital expenditure on transport infrastructure significantly rose, increasing from less than 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 per cent in 2023.[292]

In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[215][293] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative but critics said it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[215] Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[294] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in Parliament but was eventually allowed to lapse.[212] Modi's government passed the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence, subsuming around 17 taxes and became effective on 1 July 2017.[295]


Modi at the launch of the Make in India program
In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[296] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes with the intention of curbing corruption, black money, terrorism and the use of counterfeit currency.[297] The move led to severe cash shortages,[298][299][300] and a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50,[301] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country.[302] It is estimated 1.5 million jobs were lost and that one per cent of the country's GDP was wiped out.[303] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[304][305] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25 per cent and the number of digital transactions steeply increased.[306][307]

Modi's administration has observed a decline in GDP growth and increasing joblessness compared to the previous administration under Manmohan Singh.[308] During the first eight years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5 per cent compared to the rate of 7.03 per cent under the previous government.[309] Income inequality increased.[310] An internal government report said in 2017, unemployment increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 banknote demonetisation, and the effects of the Goods and Services Tax.[311][312] GDP growth was 6.12 per cent in the 2018–19 financial year, with an inflation rate of 3.4 per cent.[313] In the year 2019–20, the GDP growth rate slowed to 4.18 per cent, while inflation increased to 4.7 per cent.[314] The Indian economy shrunk by 6.6 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21, and was estimated to grow at 8.2 per cent the following financial year.[315]

Health and sanitation
See also: Swachh Bharat Mission
In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the central government's healthcare spending.[165] In January 2015, the Modi government launched its New Health Policy (NHP), which did not increase the government's spending on healthcare but emphasised the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates.[316] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices, received nearly 20 per cent less funding[317][318] in 2015 than in the previous year. The Modi administration reduced the healthcare budget by a further 15% in its second year.[319] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%; private insurance providers positively viewed the budget but public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers and said it represented a shift away from public health facilities.[320] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of ₹20 billion (US$240 million) for a government-funded health insurance program and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission.[321]

Modi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health.[316] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission ("Clean India") campaign. The campaign's stated goals included the elimination of open defecation and manual scavenging within five years.[322][323] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[324][325][326] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants,[327] and planned to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects faced allegations of corruption and severe difficulty in getting people to use the newly constructed toilets.[323][324][325] Sanitation cover in India increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018 but use of the new sanitary facilities was lower than the government's targets.[328] In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths in rural India were averted after the launch of the sanitation effort.[329]

In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi administration invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.[330][331] The same month, all commercial domestic and international flights were suspended.[332] Modi announced a 14-hour curfew on 22 March,[333] and followed with a three-week "total lockdown" two days later.[334][335] Restrictions were gradually lifted beginning in April, and were completely revoked in November 2020.[332][336][337] A second wave of the pandemic that began in March 2021 was significantly more devastating than the first; some parts of India experienced shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies.[338] In late April India reported over 400,000 cases in a 24-hour period, the first country to do so.[339] India began its vaccination programme in January 2021;[340][341] in January 2022, India announced it had administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and that more than 720 million people were fully vaccinated.[342] In May 2022, the WHO estimated 4.7 million people had died of COVID-19 in India, mostly during the second wave in mid 2021—almost 10 times the Indian government's estimate. The Modi administration rejected the WHO's estimate.[11][12]

Foreign policy

Foreign policy played a small role in Modi's election campaign and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto.[343] Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security and regional relations.[343] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of "multi-alignment".[343] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as "Make in India" and "Digital India". The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[q]


Modi meeting Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi in January 2018
India's relationship with the United States improved after Narendra Modi became PM.[345] During the run-up to the general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism about future of the strategic bilateral relationship under Modi's premiership; in 2005, while Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi was denied a US visa during the presidency of George W. Bush for his poor human-rights record.[135][136] Sensing Modi's victory well before the election, US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell contacted Modi as part of greater rapprochement from the West. Following Modi's 2014 appointment as India's PM, President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited Modi to visit the US.[346] The Modi government enjoyed a positive relationship with the US during the presidencies of Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump.[347][348]


Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia, 9 July 2024
During the first few months after his appointment as PM, Modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN and G20 summits.[343] One of Modi's first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid.[349] Modi also made several visits to the US;[350] this was described as an unexpected development because of the US's earlier denial of a US travel visa to Modi over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[350]

In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land-exchange deal with Bangladesh in the India–Bangladesh enclaves, which the government of Manmohan Singh had initiated.[212] Modi's administration brought renewed attention to India's "Look East Policy", which was instituted in 1991. The policy, which was renamed the "Act East Policy", involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[351] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar through the Indian state of Manipur; this represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[351] China–India relations rapidly deteriorated following the 2020 China–India skirmishes.[352] Modi pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, which he visited twice and was honoured with Afghanistan's highest civilian honour in 2016.[353][354] In September 2022, Modi appeared to have developed a strong personal relationship with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.[355][356][357]

India hosted the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit, during which the African Union joined the G20 as a permanent member.[358] In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries' evolving agenda under India's presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns of the Global South, including addressing climate change, debt restructuring through the G20's Common Framework for Debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies.[359][360][361] Modi's government faced scrutiny in the lead-up to the G20 meeting as multiple news sources reported that Indian authorities demolished slum neighbourhoods in New Delhi, displacing marginalised residents.[362][363][364]

Defence

India's nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi.[365] During Modi's tenure, the military budget declined, both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.[366][367] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs. Commentators wrote the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.[366][368][367]

Under Modi, India launched military modernisation initiative aimed at strengthening defence preparedness and streamlining defence acquisition.[369] Modi launched new policies under the "Aatmanirbhar Bharat" campaign, promoting indigenous defence manufacturing with policies to procure key weapon systems domestically. The government has implemented several of the recommendations from the Shekatkar Committee to streamline defence procurement and rationalise spending. Efforts have been made to establish Integrated Theatre Commands (ITCs) to enhance jointness among the services, although challenges persist in their full operationalisation.[370]

Modi promised to be "tough on Pakistan" during his election campaign and repeatedly called Pakistan an exporter of terrorism.[371][372][373] On 29 September 2016, the Modi administration said the Indian Army had conducted a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Azad Kashmir; the Indian media said up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.[374][375][376] Independent analysts said India's statement about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated.[377][378][379][380] Pakistan denied any surgical strikes to have taken place.[381] In February 2019, India carried out airstrikes against a supposed terrorist camp in Pakistan; open source satellite imagery suggested no targets of significance were hit.[382][383] Further military skirmishes, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft, occurred.[384][385][386] Eight months after the incident, the Modi administration admitted that six Indian military personnel had been killed by friendly fire.[387]


PM Modi along with Quad leaders in Washington
In May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake, Ladakh, and the Tibet Autonomous Region and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes took place in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).[388] In 2020, there were high-profile skirmishes between the nations.[389] A series of talks between India and China were held.[390] The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January; this was referred to as a minor border clash in Sikkim.[391] Modi was from late 2022 criticised for maintaining silence over the ceding of about 2,000 sq km land to China since June 2020.[392][393][394]

In December 2021, Modi signed an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend military technical cooperation.[395] The Modi government bought the S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system, strengthening the relationship between the two nations.[396] India refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and stayed neutral.[395][397] The Indian government's Operation Ganga initiative sought to return Indians stranded in Ukraine during the war. More than 19,000 Indian nationals were evacuated,[398][399] including some from neighbouring countries.[400]

Environment

While naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the "Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change", and reduced its budget allocation by more than half in his administration's first budget.[401] The new ministry removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection, and others related to industrial activity.[215] The government also tried to reconstitute the National Board for Wildlife so it would no longer have representatives from NGOs but the Supreme Court of India blocked this move.[402] Other changes included a reduction of ministry oversight on small mining projects and ending the requirement for approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. Modi also lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in India's most-polluted areas.[402] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople but criticised by environmentalists.[403]

Speaking with Assamese students in 2014, Modi downplayed climate change, saying, "Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment."[404] Later in his administration, however, he has called for climate action,[405][406] especially with the proliferation of clean energy.[407][408] In 2015, Modi proposed the International Solar Alliance initiative to encourage investment in solar energy.[409] Holding developed countries responsible,[410] Modi and his government have said India has had a negligible historical role in climate change. At the COP26 conference, Modi announced India would target carbon neutrality by 2070 and expand its renewable energy capacity.[411] Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as bold climate action.[412] India has become the only major economy to be on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals.[413] It has achieved 10 per cent of ethanol blending five months ahead of schedule.[414]

Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[f] His rule is known for weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[415][416] According to one study, "The BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists".[417][418] The Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information.[419][420] His administration has been criticised for using a democratic mandate to undermine democratic processes, including focusing on Hindu-nationalist priorities rather than economic development. Modi's second term as PM, in particular, saw the erosion of civil rights and press freedom.[421]

Modi is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress,[422] and has received consistently high approval ratings during his premiership.[423][424][425]

Modi is considered to be a vegetarian and a teetotaller.[426][427] On 31 August 2012, he posted on Google Hangouts, becoming the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat.[428][429] Modi regularly wears an ironed, half-sleeved kurta, and his suit has his name repeatedly embroidered in the pinstripes, which he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention, and criticism.[430][431][432][clarification needed] Scholars and biographers have described Modi's personality as energetic, eccentric, arrogant, and charismatic.[179][433]

The nomination of Modi for the prime-ministership drew attention to his reputation as "one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians".[159][434][435] During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader who would be able to take difficult decisions.[159][167][169][173][174] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, an unusual tactic for the BJP and RSS.[169] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and development.[436] Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[437] Modi's hardline Hindutva ideology and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[437][179][132][169]

Writing career
In 2008, Modi published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj, which contains profiles of RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji ("Guru worthy of worship").[520] According to The Economic Times, Modi's intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers, and to reassure RSS members he remained ideologically aligned with them.

After becoming the Prime Minister he also authored a book called Exam Warriors, a guide for children to commendably face exams. Modi has written eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[521] Modi has penned the lyrics of two Gujarati garba songs; Garbo, sung by Dhvani Bhanushali and composed by Tanishk Bagchi, and Maadi, sung by Divya Kumar and composed by Meet Bros. The songs were released on the occasion of autumn Navratri in 2023.[522][523]

Abundance in Millets, a song by Falu and Gaurav Shah that featured a speech given by Modi for the promotion of millet, received a nomination in the Best Global Music Performance category for the 2024 Grammy Awards.[524][525]

 Applications were filed with the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) under the RTI Act seeking details of his arrest. In reply, the PMO said it maintains official records on Modi only since he became the prime minister in 2014. Despite this claim, the official website of the PMO contains information about Modi from the 1950s.[47][48]
 Replying to an RTI query, the School of Open Learning said it did not have any data of students who received a BA degree in 1978.[49] Jayantibhai Patel, a former political science professor of Gujarat University, said the subjects listed in Modi's MA degree were not offered by the university when Modi was studying there.[56][57] In 2016, Delhi University deemed the BA degree to be authentic.[58]
 The party is commonly referred to simply as 'Congress.'
 The exact number of people killed in the train burning is variously reported. For example, the BBC says it was 59,[84] while The Guardian put the figure at 60.[85]
 By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[152] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[153]
 Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's "ease of doing business" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[161] In 2013, a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights, and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states, ranked Gujarat first among Indian states for "economic freedom".[156][162]
 In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in India with respect to rates of poverty, and 21st in education. Nearly 45 per cent of children under five were underweight and 23 per cent were undernourished, putting the state in the "alarming" category on the India State Hunger Index.[163][164] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found Gujarat under Modi had a poor record in immunisation of children.[165]
 From 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[103] It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[103] The quality of education in government schools in Gujarat ranked below that of many Indian states.[103]
 "The Narendra Modi led government completed two years in power in May 2016 and the prime minister has made his mark on both the domestic and foreign policy fronts. It is important to assess how successful his initiatives have been in the arena of foreign affairs in comparison to his predecessors. In this regard, this paper identifies and examines the key trends and issues in foreign policy under the Modi led administration and the measures needed to translate speeches and policies into action. Modi government has also taken a serious node of relations with middle-east nations, as well as Iran and Israel."[344]

The masterplot of love jihad is not just literary imaginings but also a potent brew of Islamophobia and patriarchy that harms Muslims and women. Akin to some of the post-9/11 rhetoric in the United States, contemporary Hindu nationalists propagate "a mythical history of medieval Muslim tyranny and present-day existential threat, demanding mobilization and revenge."

The fake claim by the Hindu right-wing that love jihad forces Hindu women to love and marry a Muslim man and convert to Islam is perpetuating an already existing anti-Muslim narrative in the country. The love jihad phenomenon has thus become a tool of hate and anger towards Muslims. Afrazul's killing by Raigher is an extreme demonstration of this form of hate and anger towards Muslims.

Heterosexual couples who defy caste and religious structures often face violence, some of which results in death through honor killings and lynching targeting specifically Muslim and Dalit men. For instance, the Hindutva campaign against what it calls the "love jihad" is an attempt to protect Hindu women from Muslim men, as the latter are imagined/blamed to convert Hindu women to Islam through trickery and marriage (Gupta 2018b, 85). Needless to say, these claims are unfounded and Islamophobic imaginations of the Hindu Right.

Muslims form about 15% of India's population and have suffered severe marginalization in education and employment, since the partition of Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan in 1947 (Alam, 2010). They have since faced recurrent riots (Varshney, 2003). Other hostilities include false accusations of love jihad (a conspiracy theory claiming Muslim men feign love with non-Muslim women to convert them to Islam) and attempts to convert Muslims to Hinduism by Hindu fundamentalist organizations (Gupta, 2009).

Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who is the 47th president of the United States. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.

Born into a wealthy family in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization, and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He launched side ventures, many licensing the Trump name, and filed for six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice, bolstering his fame as a billionaire. Presenting himself as a political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton.

During his first presidency, Trump imposed a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, expanded the Mexico–United States border wall, and enforced a family separation policy on the border. He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program, and initiated a trade war with China. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020, he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the CARES Act. After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Trump attempted to overturn the result, culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times.

In 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and defamation and for business fraud. He was found guilty of falsifying business records in 2024, making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony. After winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris, he was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge, and two felony indictments against him for retention of classified documents and obstruction of the 2020 election were dismissed without prejudice. A racketeering case related to the 2020 election in Georgia is pending.

Trump began his second presidency by initiating mass layoffs of federal workers. He imposed tariffs on nearly all countries, including large tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. His administration's actions—including intimidation of political opponents and civil society, deportations of immigrants, and extensive use of executive orders—have drawn over 300 lawsuits challenging their legality. High-profile cases have underscored his broad interpretation of the unitary executive theory and have led to significant conflicts with the federal courts.

Since 2015, Trump's leadership style and political agenda—often referred to as Trumpism—have reshaped the Republican Party's identity. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racist or misogynistic, and he has made false and misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Trump's actions, especially in his second term, have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history.

Early life and education

At New York Military Academy, 1964
Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump.[1] He is of German and Scottish descent.[2] He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert, in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens.[3] Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024. Trump was a millionaire in inflation-adjusted dollars by age eight.[4][a]

Trump attended the private Kew-Forest School through seventh grade. He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father's business. His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, to complete secondary school.[5] Trump considered a show business career but instead in 1964 enrolled at Fordham University.[6] Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[7][8] He was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to a claim of bone spurs in his heels.[9]

Real estate
Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[10][11] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[12] Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer, and mentor[13] for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[14] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $708 million in 2024)[15] over its charges that Trump's properties had racially discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate; four years later, the Trumps again faced the courts when they were found in contempt of the decree.[16] Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win.[17] Over three decades as of 2018, Trump had been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits,[18] liens, and other filings, often filed for nonpayment against him by employees, contractors, real estate brokers, and his own attorneys.[19] Helping Trump projects,[20] Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions.[21] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[22] Between 1991 and 2009, Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[23][24]

In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp, each with a 20 percent share. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units. In January 1994, the siblings formed Apartment Management Associates and took over the management fees formerly collected by Trump Management. As well as inflating rents, the schemes served to transfer assets from Fred Trump to his children and nephew and lower the tax burden.[25]

Manhattan and Chicago developments

In 1985 with a model of one of his aborted Manhattan development projects[26]
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[27] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[11][28] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[29] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[30] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019.[31] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks.[32] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[33]

In 1995, he defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a "vast and humiliating restructuring" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy.[34][35] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they "all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead".[34] In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building.[36] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South.[37] Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, which opened in 2008. In 2024, The New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[38]

Atlantic City casinos

In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[39] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[40] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[41] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[42] Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[39] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[43] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[44] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[45] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership.[39] He remained chairman until 2009.[46]

Golf clubs
In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[47] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[48] He declared the club his primary residence in 2019.[31] He began building and buying golf courses in 1999, owning 17 golf courses by 2016.[49]

Licensing the Trump name
See also: List of things named after Donald Trump
The Trump Organization often licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings.[50] Over 50 licensing or management deals involved Trump's name, generating at least $59 million for his companies.[51] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[50] During the 2000s, Trump licensed his name to residential property developments worldwide, 40 of which were never built.[52]

Side ventures

In 1970, Trump invested $70,000 to receive billing as coproducer of a Broadway comedy.[53] In September 1983, he purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the National Football League [NFL] for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit.[54] Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall.[39][55] In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[56] From 1986 to 1988, he purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[57] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[58] The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously".[57]

In 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $1010 million in 2024)[15] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.[59] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[60] In 1996, he purchased the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[61] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[62][63] In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[64] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants.[65]

In 2005, Trump cofounded Trump University, a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of "university" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[66] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[67] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.[68]

Foundation
Main article: Donald J. Trump Foundation
The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[69] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million, which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity,[70] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from Vince McMahon.[71] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups,[72] and charities that held events at Trump properties.[70] In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and tax evasion.[73] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general stated the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.[74] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[75] In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[76] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[77] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[78]

Legal affairs and bankruptcies
Main article: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump
According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[79] While he has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[24] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.[24] During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[80] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[81] After the January 6 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with him or his affiliated company in the future.[82]

Trump has said he began his career with "a small loan of a million dollars" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[83] He borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely did not repay the loans, and received another $413 million (2018 equivalent, adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.[84][25] Posing as a Trump Organization official named "John Barron", Trump called journalist Jonathan Greenberg in 1984, trying to get a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans.[85] Trump self-reported his net worth over a wide range: from minus $900 million in 1990[86] to $10 billion in 2015.[87] In 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth at $4.5 billion, based on interviews with more than 80 sources.[88] In 2025, the magazine estimated his net worth at $5.1 billion and ranked him the 700th wealthiest person in the world.[89]

Trump has published 19 books under his name, most written or cowritten by ghostwriters.[90] His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller, and was credited by The New Yorker with making Trump famous as an "emblem of the successful tycoon".[91] The book was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz, who is credited as a coauthor. Trump had cameos in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[92] Trump acquired his style of politics from professional wrestling—with its staged fights and name-calling.[93] He sporadically appeared for the professional wrestling company WWE from the late 1980s including Wrestlemania 23 in 2007.[94][95] Starting in the 1990s, Trump appeared 24 times as a guest on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[96] He had his own short-form talk radio program, Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[97] From 2011 until 2015, he was a guest commentator on Fox & Friends.[98] In 2021, Trump, who had been a member since 1989, resigned from SAG-AFTRA to avoid a disciplinary hearing regarding the January 6 attack.[99] Two days later, the union permanently barred him.[100]

The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice
Main articles: The Apprentice (American TV series) and The Celebrity Apprentice
Producer Mark Burnett made Trump a television star[101] when he created The Apprentice, which Trump hosted from 2004 to 2015 (including variant The Celebrity Apprentice). On the shows, he was a superrich chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase "you're fired". The New York Times called his portrayal "a highly flattering, highly fictionalized version" of himself.[102] The shows remade Trump's image for millions of viewers nationwide.[102][103] With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million.[104]

Early political aspirations

Trump registered as a Republican in 1987; a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999; a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[105]

In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in major newspapers[106] expressing his views on foreign policy and how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[107] In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request "strange and unbelievable".[108][109] Trump was a candidate in the 2000 Reform Party presidential primaries for three months before he withdrew in February 2000.[110][111][112] In 2011, Trump considered challenging President Barack Obama in the 2012 election. He spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and gave speeches in states with early primaries.[113][114] In May 2011, he announced that he would not run.[113]

2016 presidential election
Main article: 2016 United States presidential election
Further information: Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign, 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, and First presidential transition of Donald Trump
Trump announced his candidacy for the 2016 election in June 2015.[115][116] He campaigned as a rich, successful businessman and an outsider without political experience,[117][118][119] and claimed media bias against him.[120][121] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[122] and a record number were false.[123][124][125] He became the Republican front-runner in March 2016[126] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[127]

Campaigning in Arizona, March 2016
Trump described NATO as "obsolete"[128][129] and espoused views described by The Washington Post as noninterventionist and protectionist.[130] His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and strongly enforcing immigration laws. Other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations, modernizing services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated increasing military spending and extreme vetting or banning of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.[131] He promised to build a wall on the Mexico–U.S. border and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[132] He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the U.S.,[133] and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing "anchor babies".[134] According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made "explicitly racist and sexist appeals to win over white voters" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[135] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were "bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists";[136] in response, NBC fired him from Celebrity Apprentice.[137]

Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[138][139] He did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[140][141] He said his tax returns were being audited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[142] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the U.S. Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[143][144] In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that he had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[145]

Trump won 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. After elector defections on both sides, the official count was 304 to 227.[146] The fifth person to be elected president despite losing the popular vote,[b] he received nearly 2.9 million fewer votes than Clinton, 46.3% to her 48.25%.[147] He was the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[148] His election marked the return of a Republican undivided government.[c][149] Trump's victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities.[150][151]

Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. The day after his inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including 500,000 in Washington, D.C., protested against him in the Women's Marches.[152] During his first week in office, Trump signed six executive orders, including authorizing procedures for repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline projects, and planning for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[153]

Conflicts of interest
See also: First presidency of Donald Trump § Ethics
Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust,[154][155] rather than a blind trust or equivalent arrangement "to cleanly sever himself from his business interests".[156] He continued to profit from his businesses and knew how his administration's policies affected them.[155][157] Although he said he would eschew "new foreign deals", the Trump Organization pursued operational expansions in Scotland, Dubai, and the Dominican Republic.[155][157] Lobbyists, foreign government officials, and Trump donors and allies generated hundreds of millions of dollars for his resorts and hotels.[158] Trump was sued for violating the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[159] One case was dismissed in lower court.[160] Two were dismissed by the Supreme Court as moot after his term.[161]

During the campaign, Trump had pledged to donate his presidential salary[162] and profits from foreign patronage[163] to the U.S. government. He donated his salary to federal agencies and publicized each donation until July 2020. Federal agencies surveyed by The Washington Post in July 2021 reported not having received any gifts after that month.[164] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported in 2024 that he had donated $448,000 of an estimated $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments in his first term.[165]

Domestic policy
Main articles: Domestic policy of the first Donald Trump administration, Economic policy of the first Donald Trump administration, Environmental policy of the first Donald Trump administration, and Social policy of the first Donald Trump administration
Trump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history,[166] which began in 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.[167] In December 2017, he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals and eliminated the penalty associated with the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate.[168][169] The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[170] Under Trump, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.[171] By the end of his term, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high.[172] Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[173]

Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by three million people.[166][174] He rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[175][176][177][178] He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[179] He withdrew from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it.[180] He aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels.[181][182] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[183][184] He rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge.[185]

Trump dismantled federal regulations on health,[186][187] labor,[187] the environment,[188][187] and other areas, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[189] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[190] often "after requests by the regulated industries".[191] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of his proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[192] During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[193] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders.[194][195] He expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail"; his administration halved the enrollment period and drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion.[196][197] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional.[198][199] Their pleading would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans, but was unsuccessful.[198] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs. In January 2020, he expressed willingness to consider cuts to them.[200]

In response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy.[201] He barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[202] He said he supported "traditional marriage", but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage "settled".[203] His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBTQ people.[204] His attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees' civil rights protections to gender identity and sexual orientation.[205] Trump has said he is opposed to gun control, although his views have shifted over time.[206] His administration took an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[207] He is a long-time advocate of capital punishment,[208][209] and his administration oversaw the federal government execute 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined, ending a 17-year moratorium.[210] In 2016, he said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods "a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding."[211][212]

Race relations
Unite the Right rally comments
Trump's comments on the 2017 Unite the Right rally, condemning "this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides" and stating that there were "very fine people on both sides", were criticized as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters.[213] In a January 2018 discussion of immigration legislation, he reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as "shithole countries".[214] His remarks were condemned as racist.[215]

In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen—all minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans—should "go back" to the countries they "came from".[216] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240–187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his "racist comments".[217] White nationalist publications and social media praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[218] He continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[219] In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, federal law-enforcement officials used tear gas and other crowd control tactics to remove a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[220][221] Trump then posed with a Bible for a photo-op at the nearby St. John's Episcopal Church,[220][222][223] with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[224] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned his proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[225]

Pardons and commutations
Further information: List of people granted executive clemency in the first presidency of Donald Trump
During his first term, Trump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush.[226] Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[227][228] In his last full day in office, he granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences.[229] Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency.[227] The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.[230]

As president, Trump described illegal immigration as an "invasion" of the United States[231] and drastically escalated immigration enforcement.[232][233] He implemented harsh policies against asylum seekers[233] and deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border to stop illegal crossings.[234] He reduced the number of refugees admitted to record lows, from an annual limit of 110,000 before he took office to 15,000 in 2021.[235][236][237] Trump also increased restrictions on granting permanent residency to immigrants needing public benefits.[238] One of his central campaign promises was to build a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border;[239] during his first term, the U.S. built 73 miles (117 km) of wall in areas without barriers and 365 miles (587 km) to replace older barriers.[240] In 2018, Trump's refusal to sign any spending bill unless it allocated funding for the border wall[241] resulted in the longest-ever federal government shutdown, for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019.[242][243] The shutdown ended after he agreed to fund the government without any funds for the wall.[242] To avoid another shutdown, Congress passed a funding bill with $1.4 billion for border fencing in February.[244] Trump later declared a national emergency on the southern border to divert $6.1 billion of funding to the border wall[244] despite congressional disagreement.[245]

In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order that denied entry to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries for four months and from Syria indefinitely.[246][247] The order caused many protests and legal challenges that resulted in nationwide injunctions.[246][247][248] A revised order giving some exceptions was also blocked by courts,[249][250] but the Supreme Court ruled in June that the ban could be enforced on those lacking "a bona fide relationship with a person or entity" in the U.S.[251] Trump replaced the ban in September with a presidential proclamation extending travel bans to North Koreans, Chadians, and some Venezuelan officials, but excluded Iraq and Sudan.[252] The Supreme Court allowed that version to go into effect in December 2017,[253] and ultimately upheld the ban in 2019.[254] From 2017 to 2018, the Trump administration had a policy of family separation that separated over 4,400 children of illegal immigrants from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border,[255][256] an unprecedented[257] policy sparked public outrage in the country.[258] Despite Trump initially blaming Democrats[259][260] and insisting he could not stop the policy with an executive order, he acceded to public pressure in June 2018 and mandated that illegal immigrant families be detained together unless "there is a concern" of risk for the child.[261][262] A judge later ordered that the families be reunited and further separations stopped except in limited circumstances,[263][264] though over 1,000 additional children were separated from their families after the order.[256]

Trump described himself as a "nationalist"[265] and his foreign policy as "America First".[266] He supported populist, neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[267] Unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency characterized foreign relations during his tenure.[266][268] Relations between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump.[269] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested that the U.S. should withdraw from NATO.[270][271] Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[272] In 2020, Trump hosted the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize their foreign relations.[273]


Shaking hands with Russian president Vladimir Putin during the 2018 summit in Helsinki, Finland
Trump began a trade war with China in 2018 after imposing tariffs and other trade barriers he said would force China to end longstanding unfair trade practice and intellectual property infringement.[274] Trump weakened the toughest U.S. sanctions imposed after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea.[275][276] Trump praised and, according to some critics, rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin,[277][278] though he opposed some actions of Russia's government.[279] He withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian noncompliance,[280] and supported Russia's possible return to the G7.[281] As North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[282] Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, meeting Kim Jong Un three times: in Singapore in June 2018, in Hanoi in February 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in June 2019.[283] Talks in October 2019 broke down and no denuclearization agreement was reached.[284][285]

Personnel
Main articles: Political appointments of the first Trump administration and First cabinet of Donald Trump
Further information: Hiring and personnel of Donald Trump
By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[286] As of early July 2018, 61 percent of his senior aides had left[287] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[288] Both figures set a record for recent presidents.[289] Close personal aides to Trump quit or were forced out.[290] He publicly disparaged several of his former top officials.[291]

Trump had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[292] In May 2017, he dismissed FBI director James Comey, saying a few days later that he was concerned about Comey's role in the Trump–Russia investigations.[293][294] Three of Trump's 15 original cabinet members left or were forced to resign within his first year.[295][290] Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[296] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled and he had no nominee for 264.[297]

Judiciary
Further information: List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump and Donald Trump judicial appointment controversies
Trump appointed 226 federal judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.[298] His Supreme Court appointments politically shifted the Court to the right.[299][300][301] In the 2016 campaign, he pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned "automatically" if he were elected and given the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit when Roe was overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[302][303] Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. His attacks on courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.[304][305]

Trump initially ignored public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration.[306] Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29.[307] On March 27, he signed into law the CARES Act—a $2.2 trillion bipartisan economic stimulus bill—the largest stimulus in U.S. history.[308][309] After weeks of attacks to draw attention away from his slow response, Trump halted funding of the World Health Organization in April.[310] In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[311][312] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[313] although the targeted states did not meet his administration's guidelines for reopening.[314] He repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[315] such as approving unproven treatments.[316][317] In October, Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for three days with a severe case of COVID-19.[318]

Investigations

After he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[319] There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[320]

In July 2016, the FBI launched Crossfire Hurricane, an investigation into possible links between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.[321] After Trump fired Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a second investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia.[322] In January 2017, three U.S. intelligence agencies jointly stated with "high confidence" that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor Trump.[323][324] Many suspicious[325] links between Trump associates and Russian officials were discovered.[326][327][328] Trump told Russian officials he was unconcerned about Russia's election interference.[329] Crossfire Hurricane was later transferred to Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation;[330] the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia was ended by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after he told the FBI that Mueller would pursue the matter.[331][332] At the request of Rosenstein, the Mueller investigation examined criminal matters "in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference".[331] Mueller submitted his final report in March 2019.[333] The report found that Russia did interfere in 2016 to favor Trump[334] and that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged the effort,[335][336][337] but that the evidence "did not establish" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russia.[338][339] Trump claimed the report exonerated him despite Mueller writing that it did not.[340] The report also detailed potential obstruction of justice by Trump but "did not draw ultimate conclusions"[341][342] and left the decision to charge the laws to Congress.[343]

In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. He sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[344] In May, two judges ruled that both Mazars and the banks must comply with the subpoenas;[345][346][347] Trump's attorneys appealed.[348] In September 2022, Trump and the committee agreed to a settlement regarding Mazars, and the firm began turning over documents.[349]

Impeachments
Main articles: First impeachment of Donald Trump and Second impeachment of Donald Trump

Displaying the headline "Trump acquitted" in 2020
Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, though acquitted by the Senate on both occasions. The first impeachment arose from a whistleblower complaint that in 2019 Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden,[350] in an attempt to gain an advantage in the 2020 presidential election.[351] In December 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,[352] and the Senate acquitted him in February 2020.[353]

The second impeachment came after the January 6 Capitol attack, for which the House charged Trump with incitement of insurrection on January 13, 2021.[354] Trump left office on January 20, and was acquitted on February 13. Seven Republican senators voted for conviction.[355]

2020 presidential election
Further information: 2020 United States presidential election and Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign
Trump filed to run for reelection only a few hours after becoming president in 2017.[356] He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office[357] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[358] Trump's campaign focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Democratic nominee Joe Biden won.[359] He repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions[360][361] and appealed to racism.[362] Starting in early 2020, Trump sowed doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that it would be rigged and that widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[363][364] He blocked funding for the U.S. Postal Service, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[365] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to a peaceful transition of power.[366][367]

Loss to Biden and rejection of outcome
Further information: Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election and 2020–21 United States election protests
Biden won the November 2020 election, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent)[368][369] and 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232.[370] The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.[370] Trump declared victory before the results were known on the morning after the election.[371] Days later, when Biden was projected the winner, Trump baselessly alleged election fraud.[372] As part of an effort to overturn the results, Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both state and federal courts for having no factual or legal basis.[373][374]

Trump's allegations were also refuted by state election officials,[375] and the Supreme Court declined to hear a case asking it to overturn the results in four states won by Biden.[376] Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders,[377] Republican legislators,[378] the Justice Department,[379] and Vice President Pence,[380] urging actions such as replacing presidential electors,[378] or that Georgia officials "find" votes and announce a "recalculated" result.[377] In the weeks after the election, Trump withdrew from public activities.[381] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition.[382][383] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the "apparent winner" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[384] While Trump said he recommended that the GSA begin transition protocols, he still did not formally concede.[385][386] Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration on January 20.[387]

January 6 Capitol attack
Main article: January 6 United States Capitol attack
In December 2020, reports emerged that U.S. military leaders were on high alert, and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declared martial law.[388] CIA director Gina Haspel and Army general Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, grew concerned that Trump might attempt a coup or military action against China or Iran.[389][390] Milley insisted that he be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons.[391][392]


A crowd of Trump supporters during the attack
At noon on January 6, 2021, while Congress was certifying the presidential election results in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a rally at the nearby Ellipse. Speaking from behind a glass barrier,[393] he called for the election to be overturned and urged his supporters to "fight like hell" and "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol.[394] His supporters then formed a mob that broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[395] During the attack, Trump posted on social media but did not ask the rioters to disperse. In a tweet at 6 p.m., he told them to "go home with love & in peace", called them "great patriots", and restated that he had won the election.[396] Congress later reconvened and confirmed Biden's victory in the early hours of January 7.[397]

More than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died during or after the attack.[398][399] The event has been described as an attempted self-coup by Trump.[d]

Between presidencies (2021–2025)
Upon leaving the White House, Trump began living at Mar-a-Lago, establishing an office there as provided for by the Former Presidents Act.[403] His continuing false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the "big lie" by his critics, although in May 2021, he and many of his supporters began using the term to refer to the election itself.[404][405] The Republican Party used his false claims about the election to justify imposing new voting restrictions in its favor.[406][407][408] As of July 2022, he continued to pressure state legislators to overturn the election.[409] Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; a 2022 profile in The New York Times described him as a modern party boss.[410] He continued fundraising, raising a war chest containing more than twice that of the Republican Party, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on party governance and installing in key posts officials loyal to him.[410] In the 2022 midterm elections, he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices.[411] In February 2021, he registered a new company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), for providing "social networking services" to U.S. customers.[412][413] In March 2024, TMTG merged with special-purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition and became a public company.[414] In February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a social media platform.[415]

Legal issues

In 2019, journalist E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s and sued him for defamation over his denial.[416] Carroll sued him again in 2022 for battery and more defamation.[417] He was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered to pay $5 million in one case[418] and $83.3 million in the other.[418][419] In 2022, New York filed a civil lawsuit against Trump accusing him of inflating the Trump Organization's value to gain an advantage with lenders and banks.[420][421] He was found liable and ordered to pay $350 million plus interest.[421]


Classified intelligence material found during search of Mar-a-Lago
In connection with Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his involvement in the January 6 attack, in December 2022 the U.S. House committee on the attack recommended criminal charges against him for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection.[422] In August 2023, a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, indicted him on 13 charges, including racketeering, for his efforts to subvert the 2020 election in the state.[423][424]

In January 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents Trump had taken to Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House, some of which were classified.[425] In the ensuing Justice Department investigation, officials retrieved more classified documents from his lawyers.[425] On August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago for illegally held documents, including those in breach of the Espionage Act, collecting 11 sets of classified documents, some marked top secret.[426][427] A federal grand jury constituted by Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump in June 2023 on 31 counts of "willfully retaining national defense information" under the Espionage Act, among other charges.[425][428][429] Trump pleaded not guilty.[430] In July 2024, judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case, ruling Smith's appointment as special prosecutor was unconstitutional.[431]

In May 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.[432] The case stemmed from evidence that he booked Michael Cohen's hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels as business expenses to cover up his alleged 2006–2007 affair with Daniels during the 2016 election.[432][433] On January 10, 2025, the judge gave Trump a no-penalty sentence known as an unconditional discharge, saying that punitive requirements would have interfered with presidential immunity.[434] After his reelection, the 2020 election obstruction case and the classified documents case were dismissed without prejudice due to Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.[435]

2024 presidential election
Main article: 2024 United States presidential election
Further information: Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign, 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, and Second presidential transition of Donald Trump

At a rally in Arizona, August 2024
In November 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election and created a fundraising account.[436][437] In March 2023, the campaign began diverting ten percent of the donations to his leadership PAC. His campaign had paid $100 million towards his legal bills by March 2024.[438][439]

During the campaign, Trump made increasingly violent and authoritarian statements.[440][441][442][443] He said that he would weaponize the FBI and the Justice Department against his political opponents[444][445] and use the military to target Democratic politicians and those that did not support his candidacy.[446][447] He used harsher and more dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric than during his presidency.[448][449][450][451] His rhetoric, calling his political opponents "the enemy", vermin, and fascists, has been described by some historians and scholars as authoritarian, fascist,[e] and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history.[456][447][457] Age and health concerns also arose during the campaign, with several medical experts highlighting an increase in rambling, tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition.[458]

Trump mentioned "rigged election" and "election interference" earlier and more frequently than in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and refused to commit to accepting the 2024 election results.[459][460] Analysts for The New York Times described this as an intensification of his "heads I win; tails you cheated" rhetorical strategy; the newspaper stated that the claim of a rigged election had become the backbone of the campaign.[460]

On July 13, 2024, Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler Township, Pennsylvania.[461][462][463] Two days later, the 2024 Republican National Convention nominated him as their presidential candidate, with Senator JD Vance as his running mate.[464] In September, he was targeted but unharmed in an assassination attempt in Florida.[465] Trump won the election in November 2024 with 312 electoral votes to incumbent vice president Kamala Harris's 226.[466] He also won the popular vote with 49.8% to Harris's 48.3%.[467] His victory in 2024 was part of a global backlash against incumbent parties,[468][469] in part due to the 2021–2023 inflation surge.[470][471] Several outlets described his reelection as an extraordinary comeback.[472][473]

Second presidency (2025–present)
Main article: Second presidency of Donald Trump
For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Donald Trump presidencies.

Taking the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, January 20, 2025
Trump began his second term upon his inauguration on January 20, 2025.[474] He became the oldest individual to assume the presidency,[475] the first president with a felony conviction, and the second person to serve two nonconsecutive terms as president.[476]

Early actions, 2025–present
See also: First 100 days of Donald Trump's second presidency
Upon taking office, Trump signed a series of executive orders. Many of these tested his legal authority, and drew immediate legal action.[477] He issued more executive orders on his first day than any other president.[478] Four days into his second term, analysis conducted by Time found that nearly two-thirds of his executive actions "mirror or partially mirror" proposals from Project 2025.[479] In his first weeks, several of his actions ignored or violated federal laws, regulations, and the Constitution according to American legal scholars.[480][481][482] In his administration's first month, Trump issued ninety executive orders, memorandums, and directives.[483] He used the government to target his political opponents and his actions against civil society were described by legal experts and hundreds of political scientists as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding.[484][485] His orders and actions were challenged by over 300 lawsuits nationwide, with most of them still moving through the courts by July 2.[486][487]

Conflicts of interest, 2025–present
Further information: Second presidency of Donald Trump § Ethics, and Cryptocurrency in the second Donald Trump administration
Trump's second presidency was described as having fewer guardrails against conflicts of interest than his first,[488] and breaking with decades of ethical norms.[489] He maintained a publicly traded company in Truth Social, and diversified it into financial services.[490] He pursued new overseas real estate deals involving state-affiliated entities, and had several branding and licensing deals selling Trump-branded merchandise.[488] He profited from events held at his hotels and golf courses and did not place his assets in a blind trust, as previous presidents had.[491]

Trump repealed the previous administration's ethics guidelines and enforcement of laws prohibiting bribery[492][493] without establishing formal ethics guidelines for his political appointees, many of whom entered his administration with an "uncharacteristically large list of potential conflicts of interest".[494] He dropped corruption charges against politicians with ties to him[495] and paused enforcement of the law prohibiting companies operating in the U.S. to bribe foreign governments.[496]

Trump launched, promoted, and personally benefited from two cryptocurrency tokens ("meme coins"), $Trump and $Melania.[492][497] He also directly benefited from his family's cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial, which engaged in an unprecedented mixing of private enterprise and government policy.[498]

In July 2025, the Trump administration accepted a a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar to serve as Air Force One until the end of his second term and then be transferred to his presidential library. The retrofitting as the president's plane is estimated to cost up to $1 billion.[499]

Mass terminations of federal employees
Main article: 2025 United States federal mass layoffs
Trump implemented a hiring freeze across the federal government and ordered telework of federal employees to be discontinued within 30 days.[500][501] He ordered a review of many career civil service positions with the intention of reclassifying them into at-will positions without job protections.[501][502][503] He initiated mass job terminations of federal employees,[504] which were described by legal experts as unprecedented or in violation of federal law,[505] with the intent of replacing them with workers more aligned with his agenda.[506] By late February, the administration had fired more than 30,000 people.[507] To facilitate further terminations, it adopted a novel legal interpretation that vastly expands the range of departments and agencies considered as having national security for their primary function,[508][509][510] declaring various federal workers' unions "hostile".[511][512] A late March executive order based on this interpretation excluded dozens of departments and agencies from federal labor-management relations programs, prompting them to sue to invalidate their collective bargaining agreements,[513][510] which could remove union protections from one million federal employees.[511][514] He ordered an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) projects in the federal government and placed employees in DEI offices on leave. He rescinded Executive Order 11246, which mandated affirmative action and nondiscrimination practices for federal contractors.[515][516]

Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency largely dismantled several federal agencies including USAID and the Department of Education, unilaterally fired several thousand staff, and reduced administrative functions to statutory minimums.[517][518][519] Some actions, such as attempts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were paused by federal courts.[520] Many of his actions attempted to bring historically independent institutions under direct executive branch control in diminished forms.[521]

Pardons and commutations, 2025–present
Further information: List of people granted executive clemency in the second presidency of Donald Trump
As in his first presidency, Trump frequently bypassed the Office of the Pardon Attorney.[522] He installed political loyalist Ed Martin who described the rationale for granting pardons as "No MAGA left behind".[523] Trump's pardons and grants of clemency favored political allies and loyalists,[524][525] and disproportionately pardoned "the powerful, famous, well-connected and wealthy" accused of white-collar crime.[525] He granted clemency to all January 6 rioters convicted or charged on his first day in office, including those who violently attacked police, by pardoning more than 1,500 and commuting the sentences of 14.[526][527]

Domestic policy, 2025–present
Main articles: Domestic policy of the second Donald Trump administration, Economic policy of the second Donald Trump administration, Education policy of the second Donald Trump administration, and Science policy of the second Donald Trump administration
Trump inherited a resilient economy from the Biden administration, with increasing economic growth, low unemployment, and declining inflation.[f]

Trump canceled and paused federal grants and made large cuts to scientific research.[534] He appointed oil, gas, and chemical lobbyists to the EPA to reverse climate regulations and pollution controls.[535] He declared a national energy emergency, allowing the suspension of environmental regulations, loosening the rules for fossil fuel extraction and limiting renewable energy projects.[536][537] He initiated a review of the "legality and continued applicability" of the EPA endangerment finding, which is the basis of most federal regulations on greenhouse gases,[538] and again withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change.[539]

Dismantling government agencies enforcing the laws against political corruption and white-collar fraud,[540] Trump reduced the Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section from 30 to five lawyers,[541][542] dismissed 17 independent inspectors general at government agencies[543] and 12 members of independent oversight boards and watchdog agencies,[544] and disbanded the squad in the FBI's Washington field office that investigated allegations of fraud and corruption against government officials and members of Congress.[545][546] He pardoned or dropped charges against officials accused of corruption.[545]

Trump attributed societal problems to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and wokeness.[547] Equating diversity with incompetence,[547] he reversed pro-diversity policies in the federal government.[548][549] His administration aggressively moved against the rights of transgender people and what it termed "gender ideology".[550][551] He sought to remake civil society to his preferences by executive order.[552] On DEI and antisemitism grounds, he threatened cultural institutions[553] and sixty universities,[554] and forced law firms to capitulate to his political agenda.[552]

One Big Beautiful Bill Act
In July 2025, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. The bill made the tax cuts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and added additional tax deductions for a total of around $4.5 trillion, mostly benefiting the highest income brackets and costing people in the lowest income bracket $1,600 per year; increased funding for national defense, deportations, the border wall, and a missile shield; and removed tax credits for clean energy projects using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power and for buyers of electric vehicles. The bill cut funding for Medicaid and SNAP and added additional work requirements for eligibility and a $35 co-payment for some Medicaid services; the cuts and additional requirements will take effect after the 2026 general election. The bill was projected by the Congressional Budget Office to increase the budget deficit by $3.4 trillion by 2034, cause 11.8 million people to lose Medicaid coverage, and eliminate SNAP benefits for three million people.[555][556]

Immigration, 2025–present
Main articles: Immigration policy of the second Donald Trump administration and Deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump
Further information: Mexico–United States border crisis § Second Trump administration (2025–present), and Mexico–United States border wall § Second Trump administration (2025–present)
In his first days in office, Trump instructed Border Patrol agents to summarily deport illegal immigrants crossing the border, disabling the CBP One app that was being used to schedule border crossings. He resumed the remain in Mexico policy, designated drug cartels as terrorist groups, and ordered construction to be resumed on a border wall.[557][558]

Deportation operations first focused on "target lists" of criminals formed prior to Trump's second term.[559] Then his administration removed asylum applicants who failed to meet requirements,[560] revoked the parole status of immigrants who entered the U.S. under CBP One and CHNV humanitarian parole,[558] attempted to remove birthright citizenship,[561] and suspended the Refugee Admissions Program.[562] In March, he used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to imprison illegal immigrants without trial—one by "administrative error"[563] and most without criminal records[g]—at the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador.[565] He targeted activists, legal immigrants, tourists, and students with visas who expressed criticism of his policies or pro-Palestinian advocacy.[566]

Foreign policy, 2025–present
Main article: Foreign policy of the second Donald Trump administration
Further information: Tariffs in the second Trump administration, China–United States trade war, 2025 United States trade war with Canada and Mexico, and American expansionism under Donald Trump
Trump's second term foreign policy has been variously described as imperialist, expansionist,[567][568] isolationist, and autarkist, employing the "America First" ideology as its cornerstone.[569] His relations with allies were transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, including threats of annexation.[570][571] He ordered the U.S. government to stop funding and working with the WHO and announced the U.S.'s intention to formally leave the WHO.[572][573][574]

Trump and his incoming administration helped broker a Gaza war ceasefire alongside the Biden administration, enacted a day prior to his inauguration.[575][576][577] In March, Israel broke the ceasefire.[577] On June 22, 2025, the United States carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, entering the Iran–Israel war on the side of Israel.[578]


Trump and Vance in the meeting with Zelenskyy
In February 2025, Trump and Vice President Vance met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, in the Oval Office. The meeting, which was televised live, was highly contentious as Trump and Vance berated Zelenskyy. Media outlets described it as an unprecedented public confrontation between an American president and a foreign head of state.[579][580]

Trump's economic policies have been described as protectionist,[581] with Trump imposing tariffs on most countries, including large tariffs on major trading partners China, Canada, and Mexico.[582] Economists argued that the administration misunderstood the relationship between trade deficits and tariffs, using flawed assumptions.[583] He suspended American financial contributions to the World Trade Organization.[584]

Personnel, 2025–present
Main articles: Political appointments of the second Trump administration and Second cabinet of Donald Trump
In his second term, Trump selected cabinet members with personal loyalty to him,[585][586] with the "focus on loyalty over subject-matter expertise".[586] In February 2025, the White House stated that Elon Musk was a special government employee.[587] Trump gave Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to many federal government agencies.[587] Musk's teams operated in eighteen departments and agencies in the administration's first month,[588] including in the Treasury Department's $5 trillion payment system,[589] the Small Business Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration.[590] He nominated or appointed 23 former Fox News employees to his administration.[591]

Judiciary, 2025–present
See also: List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump
Following legal setbacks, Trump increased his criticism of the judiciary and called for impeachment of federal judges who ruled against him.[592] He threatened, signed executive actions, and ordered investigations into his political opponents, critics, and organizations aligned with the Democratic Party.[593] By mid-July, a Washington Post analysis found he defied judges and the courts in roughly one third of all cases against him, actions which were described by legal experts as unprecedented for any presidential administration.[594] His defiance of court orders and a claimed right to disobey the courts raised fears among legal experts of a constitutional crisis.[595] He engaged in an unprecedented targeting of law firms and lawyers that previously represented positions adverse to himself.[596][597]

Political practice and rhetoric
Further information: Trumpism, Political positions of Donald Trump, and Rhetoric of Donald Trump
Beginning with his 2016 campaign, Trump's politics and rhetoric led to the creation of a political movement known as Trumpism.[598] His political positions are populist,[599][600] more specifically described as right-wing populist.[601][602] He has been described as embracing far-right extremism,[603][604] and he helped bring far-right fringe ideas and organizations into the mainstream.[605] Many of his actions and rhetoric have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding.[606][607] Trump pushed for an expansion of presidential power under a maximalist interpretation of the unitary executive theory.[608][609] His political base has been compared to a cult of personality.[h]

Trump's rhetoric and actions have been accused of creating and exacerbating anger and distrust through the use of an "us" versus "them" narrative.[617] He explicitly and routinely disparages racial, religious, and ethnic minorities,[618] and scholars consistently find that racial animus regarding blacks, immigrants, and Muslims are the best predictors of support for Trump.[619] His rhetoric has been described as using fearmongering and demagogy which intensified during his 2024 presidential campaign.[620] He has said that he believes real power comes from fear.[621] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported his candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[622][623][624] He has a strong appeal to evangelical Christian voters and Christian nationalists,[625] and his rallies take on the symbols, rhetoric, and agenda of Christian nationalism.[626] Trump has also used anti-communist sentiment in his rhetoric, regularly calling his opponents "communists" and "Marxists".[627][628]

Racial and gender views
Main articles: Racial views of Donald Trump and Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations
Many of Trump's comments and actions have been characterized as racist.[629] In a 2018 national poll, about half of respondents said he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[630] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[631] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are strong indicators of support for Trump.[632] He has been accused of racism for insisting a group of five black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated in 2002.[633]

In 2011, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist "birther" conspiracy theory that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[634] He claimed credit for pressuring the government to publish Obama's birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent.[635] He acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. in September 2016,[636] though reportedly expressed birther views privately in 2017.[637] During the 2024 presidential campaign, he made false attacks against the racial identity of his opponent, Kamala Harris, that were described as reminiscent of the birther conspiracy theory.[638] His 2024 campaign made extensive use of dehumanizing language and racial stereotypes.[639][640][641][642] In 2025, he promoted false claims of white genocide in South Africa[643] and created the White South African refugee program.[644]

Trump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[645][646] He made lewd comments, disparaged women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[646] At least 25 women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations.[647] In October 2016, a 2005 "hot mic" recording surfaced in which he bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, "when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy."[648] He characterized the comments as "locker-room talk".[649][650] The incident's widespread media exposure led to his first public apology, videotaped during his 2016 presidential campaign.[651]

Link to violence and hate crimes
Further information: Rhetoric of Donald Trump § Violence
Trump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the U.S., both for and against him.[652][653][654] He is described as embracing extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president,[603][655] and engaging in stochastic terrorism.[656][657]

Research suggests Trump's rhetoric is associated with an increased incidence of hate crimes,[658][659] and that he has an emboldening effect on expressing prejudicial attitudes due to his normalization of explicit racial rhetoric.[660] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[661][662] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes cited his rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency.[663][664] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases, from August 2015 to April 2020, in which he was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities.[665] Trump's refusal to condemn the white supremacist Proud Boys during a 2020 presidential debate[666] and his comment, "Proud Boys, stand back and stand by", were said to have led to increased recruitment for the pro-Trump group.[667] Counterterrorism researchers described his normalization and revisionist history of the January 6 Capitol attack, and grant of clemency to all January 6 rioters, as encouraging future political violence.[668][669]

Conspiracy theories
Main article: List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump
Since before his first presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama "birtherism", global warming being a hoax, and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections.[670][671][672] After the 2020 presidential election, he promoted conspiracy theories for his defeat that were characterized as "the big lie".[673][674]

False or misleading statements
Main article: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump
Chart depicting false or misleading claims made by Trump
Fact-checkers from The Washington Post,[675] the Toronto Star,[676] and CNN[677] compiled data on "false or misleading claims" (orange background) and "false claims" (violet foreground).
Trump frequently makes false statements in public remarks[678][123] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[678][679][680] His falsehoods are a distinctive part of his political identity[679] and have been described as firehosing.[681] His false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by him during his first presidency,[675] increasing in frequency over time.[682]

Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential,[683][684] while others had more far-reaching effects, such as his unproven promotion of antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19,[685][686] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[687][688] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the "spread of radical Islamic terror", served his domestic political purposes.[689] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[690][691] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[692][693][694] He habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods.[695] Until 2018, the media rarely referred to his falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.[696][697][698]

Social media
Main articles: Social media use by Donald Trump and Twitter use by Donald Trump
See also: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump § Lawsuits over social media ban
Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He posted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January 6 attack.[699] He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press;[700] in 2017, his press secretary said that his tweets constituted official presidential statements.[701]

After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020.[702] In response, he said social media platforms "totally silence" conservatives and he would "strongly regulate, or close them down".[703] After the January 6 attack, he was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other platforms.[704] The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[705][706] and correlated with a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation on Twitter.[707] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[708] Elon Musk, after acquiring Twitter, reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022.[709][710] Meta Platforms' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram.[711]

Talking to the press, March 2017
Trump sought media attention throughout his career, maintaining a "love-hate" relationship with the press.[712] In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage,[713] estimated at $2 billion.[714] As a candidate and as president, he frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the "fake news media" and "the enemy of the people".[715]

The first Trump presidency reduced formal press briefings from about one hundred in 2017 to about half that in 2018 and to two in 2019; they also revoked the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[716] Trump's 2020 presidential campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about his stance on Russian election interference. All the suits were dismissed.[717][718] By 2024, Trump repeatedly voiced support for outlawing political dissent and criticism,[719] and said that reporters should be prosecuted for not divulging confidential sources and media companies should possibly lose their broadcast licenses for unfavorable coverage of him.[720]

Following his reelection, Trump launched lawsuits and created blacklists against certain media outlets, and took over the process run by the White House Correspondents' Association to choose what outlets have access to him.[721] Rather than comply with a court order to restore Associated Press access, the White House made a policy of limited access for all wire services.[722] The Federal Communications Commission launched investigations into media outlets accused of bias against him.[723]

Personal life
Family
Further information: Trump family
In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková.[724] They had three children: Donald Jr. (b. 1977), Ivanka (b. 1981), and Eric (b. 1984). The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with model and actress Marla Maples.[725] He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (b. 1993), whom Maples raised in California.[726] In 2005, he married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[727] They have one son, Barron (b. 2006).[728]

Health
Main article: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump
Trump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[729][730] He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[731][732] He has called golfing his "primary form of exercise", but usually does not walk the course.[733] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is "like a battery, with a finite amount of energy", which is depleted by exercise.[734][735] In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that he would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".[736] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein's office.[736][737]

Religion
Main article: Donald Trump and religion
Trump said in 2016 that he was a Presbyterian and a Protestant.[738][739] In 2020, he said he was a nondenominational Christian.[740] However, many have questioned the depth of these religious affiliations. A survey during Trump's first presidency (2017–2021) showed that 63 percent of Americans did not believe he was religious, despite his professed Christian affiliation, and that only 44 percent of Americans believed that Trump was a Christian.[741] Some of Trump's comments on the Bible or Christian practice have led critical observers to suggest that his knowledge of Christianity is superficial or erroneous, and few biographers have described Trump as deeply or even particularly religious.[742][743]

Assessments
Public image

See also: Opinion polling on the first Donald Trump administration and Opinion polling on the second Donald Trump administration
In Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2020, international approval ratings of U.S. leadership dropped from about 22 percent in a Gallup poll[744] of 134 countries to just 16 percent—lower than China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin—in a Pew Research poll[745] of 13 countries. In 2017, estimation of U.S. leadership declined most among allies.[746]

Domestically, in his first term, Trump had chiefly partisan support: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.[747] In a 2021 Gallup poll, he was the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating, and he was the first not to be named most admired in his first year in office.[748]

In his second term's first quarter according to Gallup, Trump's approval rating was 45 percent—somewhat better than his first term, and far below the 60 percent average of other presidents. Support remained polarized; he had the approval of 90 percent among Republicans, 37 percent among independents, and 4 percent among Democrats.[749]

Scholarly rankings
Further information: Historical rankings of presidents of the United States
In C-SPAN's 2021 survey of presidential historians,[750] historians ranked Trump as the fourth-worst president. He rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.[751][752] The Siena College Research Institute's 2022 survey ranked him third-worst. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership, and ranked last in several categories.[753] In 2018 and 2024, members of the American Political Science Association ranked him the worst president.[754][755]

Notes
 Beginning when Trump was three years old, his father gave each of his children $6,000 every year, the maximum allowed without incurring a gift tax. To avoid taxes, Fred made them landlords of two of his housing developments, paying each $13,928 in rent every year.
 Presidential elections in the U.S. are decided by the Electoral College. Each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress and (in most states) all electors vote for the winner of their state's popular vote.

[...] The Post examined 337 lawsuits filed against the administration since Trump returned to the White House and began a rapid-fire effort to reshape government programs and policy. As of mid-July, courts had ruled against the administration in 165 of the lawsuits. The Post found that the administration is accused of defying or frustrating court oversight in 57 of those cases — almost 35 percent. Legal experts said the pattern of conduct is unprecedented for any presidential administration and threatens to undermine the judiciary's role as a check on an executive branch asserting vast powers that test the boundaries of the law and Constitution.

He not only revived some of the same expansive understandings of executive authority that were left unaddressed, but went even further with new claims of sweeping and inherent constitutional clout.

The relationship between the former U.S. President and the Indian Prime Minister was characterized by mutual admiration and strategic collaboration. They often showcased their partnership through high-profile public events in each other's countries, emphasizing shared democratic values and a common vision for global security. Despite occasional disagreements over trade policies and tariffs, both leaders maintained a warm rapport, using their alliance to strengthen defense cooperation and economic ties. Their camaraderie was also seen as a united front in counterbalancing rising regional powers, reflecting a significant chapter in modern diplomatic relations.
